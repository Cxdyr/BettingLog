Application that allows for the user to register and login, then enter a +- double that updates when saved and a string of text that is saved and can be updated each session.

Background: I sports bet often and find myself losing track of my profit, bets etc, I also bet on small things that aren't available on current applications that do the same thing.
I am also working with a team to create a functioning application that aggregates streaming services and I am working on the front end interface and wanted to use similar methods 
to make this side project. It took me about an hour to make and works fairly decently.
